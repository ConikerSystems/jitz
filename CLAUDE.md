# Jitz — repo notes

**At session start:** check git sync, then read **`HANDOFF.md`** for where we left off.

This program follows the **Coniker Hub conventions**: Claude does all git (sync at start, push
when done); local/private data stays on the Mac (never pushed); web apps follow the shared
WEB_APP_STANDARDS — PWA + offline service worker, single-source version, in-app **🔄 Update**
button, `© <year> Coniker Systems™ · v<version>` footer, Coniker-standard About page, and never
trap a standalone (home-screen) app with top-level navigation.

Jitz specifics: vanilla **static PWA**, no build step; curriculum data lives in `moves.json`;
in-app YouTube player; per-device progress plus star ratings that surface top instructors. Bump
`static/js/version.js` **and** `CACHE_NAME` in `sw.js` together on every deploy.

<!-- SOURCE-POLICY:START -->
## Source of truth: GitHub (master) — managed by Claude Hub

**GitHub is the master for Jitz.** Develop in the cloud (claude.ai/code, or the Claude app on iPhone) — pick this repo and the "Cloud › Claude" environment. Do NOT develop on the Mac.

On the Mac this repo is a **replica**: each session pulls from GitHub first (safe fast-forward) and the local copy is never hand-edited. If it is detached to a pointer, `git clone` to restore a local copy. Databases/data stay local regardless — GitHub holds code only.
